Project: Celestial Music
Author:  Max Bogue

Done as a final project for Music of the Spheres, a curious class with
professor Joel Kastner at RIT.  The class focused on the ancient relationship
between music and astronomy, and simultaneously on modern techniques for
finding planets.

This project is a simple program that takes solar system structure as
input and produces an audio/visualization of that solar system.

See the sol.json file for example input.

To run using GHC:

$ ghc CelestialMusic.hs && ./CelestialMusic sol.json
